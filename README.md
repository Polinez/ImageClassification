Image Classification using ResNet50 on a semestral project

I have learned how to collect and prepare data for machine learning to make accurate predictions.

I also gained the ability to calculate and interpret key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. 

Additionally, I understand when to focus on each metric depending on the situation, enabling better evaluation and optimization of machine learning models.
